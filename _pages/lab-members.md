<p class="box-body"><img class="small-round" src="/assets/people/pjkohler.png" alt="Peter">Peter is originally from Denmark, but have lived and worked in North America since 2007. He received his PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience in 2013 from Dartmouth College, before becoming a post-doctoral scholar at Stanford University, working with Professor Tony Norcia. He joined York University as an Assistant Professor in 2019. He is a Core Member of [Vision: Science to Applications (VISTA)](https://vista.info.yorku.ca/) and a member of the [Center for Vision Research](http://cvr.yorku.ca/) at York University. <a href="/assets/cv-pjkohler.pdf" target="_blank">Download CV</a>. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kV2t964AAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>. <a href="https://publons.com/author/1193872/peter-j-kohler#profile" target="_blank">Publons</a>.

<b>We are currently recruiting graduate students!</b> For more information on applying to the graduate program in Psychology at York University, please see [here](https://psychology.gradstudies.yorku.ca/). Please note that if you are interested in being supervised by Professor Kohler, <b>you must select Brain, Behaviour and Cognitive Sciences (BBCS) as your first choice area of specialization</b> during the application process, otherwise he will not have access to your application.<br><br><b>We are also recruiting undergraduate students!</b> Please get in touch if you are an undergrad at York who is interested in learning about using behavioral methods, EEG and functional MRI to study the human visual system.</p>

<p class="box-body"><img class="small-round" src="/assets/people/rmoreau.png" alt="RachelMoreau">Rachel did her undergraduate at Carleton University and is a first year Master's student in the Brain, Behavior and Cognitive Science stream at York. She is currently co-supervised by Dr. Kohler and Dr. [Erez Freud](https://freud.lab.yorku.ca/). She is interested in understanding how low-level visual cues (symmetry, color, numeracy, motion, etc.) contribute to complex processes such as object recognition and spatial awareness. Making use of both neuroimaging and behavioral methods, she hopes to develop a richer understanding of how simple visual qualities can come together as rich, meaningful information in the brain. Rachel's research interests are heavily motivated by her love of painting, film, and graphic design. Rachel was awarded a [scholarship from VISTA](https://vista.info.yorku.ca/opportunities/masters-scholarships/) that will support her Master's studies.

<p class="box-body"><img class="small-round" src="/assets/people/lgodley.png" alt="LindaGodley">Linda is in her third year of undergraduate studies in the specialized honours Cognitive Science program at York University, with a special interest in Psychology. She is interested in examining and better understanding the visual system of the brain through fMRI technology, how it processes different types of visual inputs, and the neural architectures underlying these processes. In her free time, Linda enjoys writing, practicing calligraphy, and playing her ukulele.

<p class="box-body"><img class="small-round" src="/assets/people/clee.png" alt="ChristopherLee">Christopher is a third-year undergraduate student at York University’s honours program in Applied Mathematics. Christopher is currently interested in using data science, image analysis, and graph theory to more effectively analyze data for the purpose of better understanding visual and other neurological processes. He has become well versed in creating and improving existing scripts use for stimulus generation and data collection in the lab. Christopher can often be found watching videos of math and computer science lectures for fun, reading, or playing video games to relax after a long day of lab work.

<p class="box-body"><img class="small-round" src="/assets/people/rlysenko.png" alt="RachelLysenko">Rachel is an Honours Psychology student in her second year of undergraduate studies at York University. Her current research interests include the neural basis of visual working memory in relation to pattern and object recognition of symmetrical and asymmetrical generated images. She hopes to expand her understanding of how behavioural studies and neuroimaging are used for further conceptualization of the human visual system. Rachel enjoys the outdoors, playing piano, and reading science fiction.

Her current research interests includes using fMRI technology to explore shape sensitivity in the dorsal and ventral visual streams, as well as exploring how object symmetry is represented in the brain. Andreja has become an expert in collecting behavioral data that can supplement our experiments in the lab. When she is not doing science, she enjoys baking, cooking, and catching up on tv shows!
